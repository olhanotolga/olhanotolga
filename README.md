### I'm Olha, a web developer based in Berlin.

Before I landed here, I used to write content for tech companies and translate films.

I'm currently learning web development with MERN stack, Python, and falling in love with design systems.

🔭 My aspiration is to create performant, accessible, and well-designed applications that minimize the information overload and help people make informed decisions.

Apart from programming, I love mountains ⛰️, bird watching 🐦, and fungi 🍄.
